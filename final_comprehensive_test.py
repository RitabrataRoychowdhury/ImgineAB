    MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT
    
    This Material Transfer Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between ImaginAb, Inc. ("Provider") 
    and Molecular Nuclear Research Institute ("MNRI", "Recipient") for the transfer of research materials.
    
    PARTIES:
    Provider: ImaginAb, Inc., 123 Biotech Drive, San Diego, CA
    Recipient: Molecular Nuclear Research Institute (MNRI), 456 Research Blvd, Boston, MA
    
    EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 2024
    EXPIRATION DATE: October 31, 2024
    
    1. MATERIALS: Provider will transfer antibody materials (Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, 
       Catalog #AB-2024-001, Quantity: 5mg) for research use only.
    
    2. AUTHORIZED LOCATION: Materials must be stored at MNRI facilities at 456 Research Blvd, 
       Boston, MA in temperature-controlled conditions (-80¬∞C freezer).
    
    3. RESEARCH PLAN: 
       - Objective 1: Conduct imaging studies using the transferred materials
       - Objective 2: Evaluate binding specificity in mouse models
       - Exclusions: No human studies, no commercial applications
    
    4. DELIVERABLES:
       - Quarterly progress reports due every 3 months
       - Final report due within 30 days of agreement termination
       - Publication acknowledgment required
    
    5. PUBLICATION: Any publication must acknowledge Provider and follow IP protection guidelines.
       Publications must be submitted to Provider 30 days prior to submission for review.
    
    6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: 
       - Provider retains ownership of original materials
       - Any derivatives or improvements developed by MNRI shall be jointly owned
       - Patent rights for new imaging methods shall be shared 50/50
    
    7. CONFIDENTIALITY: All information shall remain confidential for 5 years after termination.
    
    8. TERMINATION: 
       - Agreement expires October 31, 2024
