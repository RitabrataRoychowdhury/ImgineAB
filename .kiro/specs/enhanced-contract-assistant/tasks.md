  - **Advanced Document Analysis**: Enhance contract analysis with cross-referencing between sections, exhibit integration, timeline analysis, party obligation mapping, risk matrix generation, and compliance requirement identification
  - **Intelligent Response Formatting**: Implement dynamic response structuring based on question complexity, user expertise level detection, progressive disclosure for complex topics, visual formatting with bullet points and sections, and adaptive explanation depth
  - **Context-Aware Conversation Enhancement**: Build sophisticated conversation memory with topic threading, follow-up question anticipation, personalized response adaptation, expertise level adjustment, and conversation flow optimization
