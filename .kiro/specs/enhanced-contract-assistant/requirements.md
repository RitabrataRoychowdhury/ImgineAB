# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing contract analyst engine with improved conversational behavior, graceful handling of off-topic questions, and specialized Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) expertise. The system will ensure users always receive helpful responses, even for irrelevant questions, while maintaining the existing structured analysis format for document-related queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the contract analyst, I want the system to always provide helpful responses even for off-topic or irrelevant questions, so that I never encounter silence or unhelpful "not enough information" messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks an irrelevant, nonsensical, or playful question THEN the system SHALL always respond gracefully without staying silent
2. WHEN a question is off-topic THEN the system SHALL acknowledge it's unrelated and either redirect politely or provide a conversational response
3. WHEN a question is related to contracts but not covered in the document THEN the system SHALL provide general legal/industry knowledge with clear transparency about the source
4. WHEN the system provides general knowledge THEN it SHALL prefix responses with "The uploaded agreement does not cover this, but typically..." or similar transparency language
5. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL provide light, conversational, or humorous responses to playful questions while maintaining professionalism
6. IF a user asks multiple questions at once THEN the system SHALL answer each clearly in one structured response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a legal professional working with Material Transfer Agreements, I want specialized MTA expertise and behavior, so that I can get accurate, contextual analysis specific to research agreements and material transfer scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing MTA documents THEN the system SHALL demonstrate specialized knowledge of research agreements, IP rights, and material transfer protocols
2. WHEN questions involve MTA-specific concepts THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware responses using appropriate terminology (Provider, Recipient, Original Material, derivatives, etc.)
3. WHEN discussing MTA implications THEN the system SHALL consider research collaboration dynamics, IP protection, and typical MTA risk factors
4. WHEN providing examples or analogies THEN the system SHALL use research and academic contexts relevant to MTAs
5. WHEN explaining complex MTA clauses THEN the system SHALL relate them to practical research scenarios and common academic practices
6. IF MTA-specific guidance is needed THEN the system SHALL provide industry-standard practices and common MTA patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced fallback responses and redirection capabilities, so that I can always get value from my interaction even when my question doesn't directly relate to the uploaded document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract-related question isn't covered in the document THEN the system SHALL provide general legal knowledge while clearly indicating the information source
2. WHEN redirecting from off-topic questions THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant document-related questions or topics
3. WHEN providing fallback responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the professional but approachable tone established for contract analysis
4. WHEN offering general knowledge THEN the system SHALL provide practical, context-aware insights rather than generic information
5. WHEN a question could be interpreted multiple ways THEN the system SHALL address the most likely interpretation while acknowledging alternatives
6. IF the user seems confused or frustrated THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions for better ways to ask questions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced contract assistant to maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality, so that current users experience seamless improvements without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing document-related questions THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing structured response format (Direct Evidence, Plain-English Explanation, Implication/Analysis)
2. WHEN analyzing contracts THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing contract analysis capabilities and accuracy
3. WHEN integrating enhanced behavior THEN the system SHALL not break existing API contracts or response formats
4. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to existing behavior if enhanced features fail
5. WHEN logging interactions THEN the system SHALL maintain existing logging patterns while adding new behavioral tracking
6. IF enhanced features cause performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options to adjust or disable specific enhancements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved conversation flow and contextual awareness, so that my interactions feel natural and the system understands the progression of our discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL reference previous responses and maintain conversation context
2. WHEN switching between serious and casual topics THEN the system SHALL adjust tone appropriately while maintaining professionalism
3. WHEN a user makes jokes or casual comments THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately without losing focus on the document analysis capability
4. WHEN providing examples or analogies THEN the system SHALL choose relevant, engaging examples that enhance understanding
5. WHEN clarifying complex topics THEN the system SHALL break down information into digestible parts while maintaining accuracy
6. IF conversation becomes repetitive THEN the system SHALL recognize patterns and suggest new directions or topics
