# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a robust contract analysis assistant that ALWAYS responds with structured, useful output regardless of input style, tone, or clarity. The system will implement specific response patterns for different question types, ensure automatic table/data exports, and provide consistent structured analysis while adapting to user communication styles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user asking any type of question, I want the system to always provide structured, useful output regardless of how I phrase my question, so that I never encounter silence, refusal to engage, or unhelpful responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks any question THEN the system SHALL always respond with structured, useful output
2. WHEN a question is unclear or ambiguous THEN the system SHALL interpret it and provide the most likely analysis while acknowledging alternatives
3. WHEN a question uses casual language, slang, or informal tone THEN the system SHALL match the user's energy while maintaining professional structure
4. WHEN a question is absurd or hypothetical THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the tone and pivot to structured contract analysis
5. WHEN multiple interpretations are possible THEN the system SHALL address the primary interpretation and offer alternatives
6. IF a user provides incomplete information THEN the system SHALL work with available context and request clarification when needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user asking document-specific questions, I want consistent structured responses with clear evidence, explanations, and implications, so that I can quickly understand contract details and their practical impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question relates to document content THEN the system SHALL use the format: Evidence (with quotes/references), Plain English explanation, and Implications (practical consequences/risks)
2. WHEN quoting document content THEN the system SHALL use the üìã Evidence section with direct quotes or specific references
3. WHEN explaining complex terms THEN the system SHALL use the üîç Plain English section with simplified explanations
4. WHEN discussing practical impact THEN the system SHALL use the ‚öñÔ∏è Implications section with consequences, risks, and actionable insights
5. WHEN evidence spans multiple sections THEN the system SHALL synthesize information across document sections
6. IF document doesn't contain requested information THEN the system SHALL clearly state what's missing and provide general guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user asking general legal questions not covered in the document, I want transparent responses that clearly distinguish between document content and general legal knowledge, so that I understand the source and reliability of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question involves legal concepts not in the document THEN the system SHALL use the format: Status (document coverage), General Rule (standard practice/law), and Application (practical implementation)
2. WHEN providing general legal information THEN the system SHALL prefix with "‚ÑπÔ∏è Status: Document doesn't cover this, but typically..." or similar transparency language
3. WHEN explaining general legal principles THEN the system SHALL use the üìö General Rule section with standard practices or legal principles
4. WHEN showing practical application THEN the system SHALL use the üéØ Application section with real-world implementation guidance
5. WHEN combining document and general knowledge THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between sources
6. IF general knowledge is uncertain THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels and suggest professional consultation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user requesting data, tables, or structured information, I want automatic generation of downloadable exports and clear tabular presentation, so that I can easily use the information in other tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data in table format THEN the system SHALL provide structured tables with clear headers
2. WHEN tabular data is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create downloadable CSV/Excel links
3. WHEN presenting structured data THEN the system SHALL end responses with "üì• Export: CSV/Excel available here" or similar download prompt
4. WHEN data spans multiple categories THEN the system SHALL organize into logical table sections
5. WHEN export files are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting and data integrity
6. IF data is too complex for simple tables THEN the system SHALL provide multiple export options or formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with varying communication styles, I want the system to adapt its tone and complexity to match my input while maintaining structured analysis, so that interactions feel natural and appropriately matched to my expertise level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses casual language THEN the system SHALL match the energy level while maintaining professional structure
2. WHEN a user uses business/formal language THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate formality
3. WHEN a user uses startup/tech language THEN the system SHALL adapt terminology while preserving legal accuracy
4. WHEN a user asks multi-part questions THEN the system SHALL break responses into numbered components with synthesis
5. WHEN a user provides context about their role THEN the system SHALL adjust complexity and focus accordingly
6. IF tone adaptation conflicts with accuracy THEN the system SHALL prioritize accuracy while maintaining approachable language

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user dealing with complex or ambiguous inputs, I want clear interpretation acknowledgment and comprehensive coverage of possible meanings, so that I can be confident the system understood my intent correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question has multiple possible interpretations THEN the system SHALL use format: "ü§î My Take: I'm reading this as [interpretation]" followed by "If Option A/B" alternatives
2. WHEN handling ambiguous inputs THEN the system SHALL address the most likely interpretation first
3. WHEN providing alternative interpretations THEN the system SHALL structure each option clearly with separate analysis
4. WHEN synthesizing multiple interpretations THEN the system SHALL explain how different meanings connect or conflict
5. WHEN user intent is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions while providing initial analysis
6. IF multiple valid approaches exist THEN the system SHALL present options and recommend the most practical approach
