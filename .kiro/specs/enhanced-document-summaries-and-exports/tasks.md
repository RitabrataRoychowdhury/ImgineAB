  - Create SummaryGenerator that produces structured summaries with Overview, Key Terms, Important Dates, Liabilities & Risks, and Recommended Actions sections tailored to document type
  - Add DocumentIndexManager for portfolio-level tracking, relationship mapping between documents, deadline alerts, and searchable metadata storage
  - Build comprehensive unit tests for document parsing accuracy, classification, risk analysis, and summary generation across all document types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 2. Build never-fail Excel export system with full UI integration and comprehensive testing

  - Add secure download link generation with expiration management, automatic cleanup, and DataFormatter for converting any response content into exportable formats
  - Create comprehensive end-to-end testing covering document upload → summary generation → risk analysis → Excel export workflow, UI integration, never-fail guarantee, real-world document scenarios, and load testing with concurrent requests
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6_
