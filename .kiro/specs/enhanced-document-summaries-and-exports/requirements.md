5. WHEN export files are created THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity, proper formatting, and include metadata about the analysis
6. IF the system cannot generate an Excel export THEN it SHALL provide clear explanation and alternative data presentation methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with different types of agreements, I want specialized summary templates for different document types (contracts, MTAs, purchase agreements, etc.), so that I get relevant information organized appropriately for each document type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN document type is unclear THEN the system SHALL use a general template while identifying the most likely document type
6. IF specialized templates are needed THEN the system SHALL allow customization based on organization requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple documents, I want an organized index and tracking system that shows the status, key dates, and relationships between different agreements, so that I can maintain oversight of all contractual obligations.

4. WHEN organizing information THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and searching by document type, parties, dates, and key terms
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide portfolio-level analysis across multiple documents
6. IF documents reference each other THEN the system SHALL identify and map these relationships in the index

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user requesting specific data formats, I want the system to automatically detect when I'm asking for tabular information and provide both visual display and downloadable exports, so that I never encounter refusal to provide data in usable formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for data in table format THEN the system SHALL provide both visual display and automatic download links
2. WHEN generating tabular data THEN the system SHALL never respond with "I cannot provide an Excel sheet" but instead SHALL create the requested format
3. WHEN creating exports THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options (Excel, CSV, PDF) based on data type and user needs
4. WHEN data is complex THEN the system SHALL organize it into multiple sheets or sections with clear navigation
5. WHEN export generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative formats and clear explanation of limitations
6. IF data cannot be exported THEN the system SHALL explain why and provide the best available alternative presentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user analyzing document risks, I want detailed risk assessment reports that categorize risks by type, severity, and impact, with specific recommendations for mitigation, so that I can make informed decisions about contractual arrangements.
