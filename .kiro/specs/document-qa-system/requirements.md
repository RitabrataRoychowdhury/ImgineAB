# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing document processing system in `a.py` to create a comprehensive document Q&A system. The system will allow users to upload documents, process them using Gemini AI through a LangGraph workflow, and then ask questions about the processed documents to get intelligent answers. The system builds upon the current workflow architecture while adding document storage, Q&A capabilities, and an improved user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a web interface, so that I can process and analyze them without manually copying text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a file upload component that accepts common document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
2. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size (max 10MB)
3. WHEN a valid document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract the text content and store it for processing
4. IF the document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to process uploaded documents using an enhanced LangGraph workflow, so that I can get structured analysis and enable Q&A functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the LangGraph processing workflow
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress updates to the user
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL store the processed results including extracted information, analysis, and document embeddings
4. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL enable Q&A functionality for that document

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about processed documents, so that I can quickly find specific information without reading the entire document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL display a Q&A interface with a question input field
2. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL use the processed document context to generate an accurate answer using Gemini
3. WHEN an answer is generated THEN the system SHALL display the answer with relevant source excerpts from the document
4. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which document to query
5. IF no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the answer cannot be found in the document

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple processed documents, so that I can organize and query different documents efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN the system SHALL display a document list with titles and processing status
2. WHEN a user selects a document from the list THEN the system SHALL load that document's Q&A interface
3. WHEN a user wants to delete a document THEN the system SHALL remove the document and its processed data after confirmation
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL persist previously processed documents across sessions
5. IF storage limit is reached THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest removing old documents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be scalable and maintainable, so that it can handle increased usage and be easily extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL use modular architecture with separate components for UI, processing, and storage
2. WHEN processing multiple documents THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent processing efficiently
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing processed documents
5. IF the system needs configuration changes THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or configuration files rather than hardcoded values
