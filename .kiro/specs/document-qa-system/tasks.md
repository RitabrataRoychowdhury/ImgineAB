# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up enhanced project structure and dependencies

  - Create modular directory structure for the enhanced system
  - Install and configure required dependencies (streamlit, langgraph, sqlite3, python-docx, PyPDF2)
  - Create configuration management for API keys and settings
  - Set up database schema for document storage and Q&A sessions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.5_

- [x] 2. Implement file upload and text extraction system

  - Create FileUploadHandler class with support for PDF, TXT, and DOCX formats
  - Implement file validation (format, size limits) and error handling
  - Build text extraction service using appropriate libraries for each format
  - Create Streamlit-based web interface with file upload component
  - Add real-time upload progress and validation feedback
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance existing workflow with LangGraph and add storage capabilities

  - Refactor existing workflow nodes from `a.py` to work with proper LangGraph StateGraph
  - Add new embedding_generation_node and storage_node to the workflow
  - Implement DocumentStorage class with SQLite backend for metadata and processing results
  - Create document persistence layer that stores original text, extracted info, and analysis
  - Add processing job tracking with status updates for real-time UI feedback
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Build Q&A engine and document management interface

  - Create QAEngine class that uses processed document context for question answering
  - Implement context retrieval system that finds relevant document sections for questions
  - Build Q&A interface in Streamlit with chat-like interaction
  - Create document management UI showing list of processed documents with status
  - Add document selection and deletion functionality with confirmation dialogs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Integrate all components and add error handling
  - Connect file upload, processing workflow, storage, and Q&A components into unified system
  - Implement comprehensive error handling for file processing, API failures, and storage issues
  - Add logging system for debugging and monitoring processing jobs
  - Create main application entry point that launches the Streamlit interface
  - Write unit tests for core components (file handling, workflow nodes, Q&A engine)
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4, plus error handling from all other requirements_
