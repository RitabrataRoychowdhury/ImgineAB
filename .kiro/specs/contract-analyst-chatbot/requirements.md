# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement transforms the existing Document Q&A System into a specialized Contract Analyst Chatbot that helps users understand legal and research agreements, with primary focus on Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). The chatbot will provide structured, evidence-based analysis of legal documents using a specific response format that grounds answers in the document text while providing plain-English explanations and implications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher or legal professional, I want the chatbot to analyze legal documents with structured responses that cite specific clauses, so that I can understand both the literal text and its practical implications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about a legal document THEN the system SHALL provide responses in a three-part format: Direct Evidence, Plain-English Explanation, and Implication/Analysis
2. WHEN citing evidence THEN the system SHALL quote or paraphrase specific clauses, sections, or exhibits from the document
3. WHEN providing explanations THEN the system SHALL translate legal language into conversational, professional language
4. WHEN analyzing implications THEN the system SHALL identify who benefits, what risks exist, or what actions are required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user analyzing subjective aspects of agreements, I want the chatbot to provide balanced reasoning using document evidence rather than claiming insufficient information, so that I can understand the practical impact of contract terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is subjective (e.g., "who benefits more?") THEN the system SHALL provide balanced reasoning using evidence from ownership, IP, liability, or restrictions
2. WHEN information appears to be missing THEN the system SHALL infer from available contract elements rather than stating "the document doesn't say"
3. WHEN multiple sections are relevant THEN the system SHALL summarize across them instead of giving single-clause answers
4. WHEN analyzing benefits or risks THEN the system SHALL identify specific parties and explain the reasoning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with Material Transfer Agreements, I want the chatbot to understand MTA-specific terminology and structures, so that I can get accurate analysis of research collaboration terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing MTAs THEN the system SHALL recognize standard MTA sections including materials ownership, IP rights, reporting requirements, and liability terms
2. WHEN discussing IP rights THEN the system SHALL distinguish between material ownership, derivative rights, and independent inventions
3. WHEN explaining reporting obligations THEN the system SHALL identify specific deliverables, timelines, and recipients
4. WHEN analyzing research restrictions THEN the system SHALL explain permitted uses, prohibited activities, and compliance requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to maintain its enhanced analytical capabilities across different types of legal documents, so that I can use it for various contract analysis needs beyond MTAs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing non-MTA legal documents THEN the system SHALL apply the same structured response format
2. WHEN encountering different contract types THEN the system SHALL adapt its analysis to relevant legal concepts (liability, obligations, rights, etc.)
3. WHEN analyzing any legal document THEN the system SHALL maintain professional, conversational tone while avoiding unnecessary legalese
4. WHEN providing document analysis THEN the system SHALL ensure responses are grounded in the actual document text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced contract analysis capabilities to integrate seamlessly with the existing document upload and management system, so that I can analyze legal documents using the same familiar interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading legal documents THEN the system SHALL detect document type and apply appropriate analysis prompts
2. WHEN switching between regular Q&A and contract analysis modes THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity
3. WHEN viewing document management interface THEN the system SHALL indicate which documents have contract analysis capabilities
4. WHEN accessing Q&A for legal documents THEN the system SHALL automatically use the enhanced contract analyst prompts and formatting
