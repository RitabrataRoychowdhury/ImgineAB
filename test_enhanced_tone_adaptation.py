Test Enhanced Tone Adaptation and Multi-Input Handling

This test validates the implementation of task 2:
- Intelligent tone matching (casual↔business↔technical)
- Multi-part question parsing with numbered component responses
- Ambiguity interpretation system with multiple analysis paths
- UI integration with structured patterns
